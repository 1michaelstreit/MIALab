Medical Images
--------------------

The medical images will be provided trough Ilias.

The dataset consists of 3 T head MRIs of 100 unrelated subjects from the `Human Connectome Project (HCP) <https://www.humanconnectome.org/>`_ dataset of healthy volunteers [2]_. For each subject, the following data is available:

- T1-weighted MR image volume, skull-stripped and non-skull-stripped (but defaced for anonymization [3]_)
- T2-weighted MR image volume, processed the same way as the T1 image
- Both modalities in native subject-space and in MNI-atlas space [4]_

The following labels are available:

- 0: Background
- 1: Cortical and cerebellar white matter
- 2: Cerebral and cerebellar cortex / grey matter
- 3: Ventricles (lateral, inferior lateral, third and fourth ventricles merged)

The ground truth labels are generated by FreeSurfer (e.g., [5]_)  and are not manual expert annotations.
As you will see when opening some example label maps, the automated labelling is not perfect. This is a common problem in the medical analysis domain, often real expert annotations are sparse and a "silver-standard" ground truth has to be used.

In every subject-data directory you find the following files:

- T1native.nii.gz: T1weighted MR image in native subject space, not skull-stripped and not bias field corrected.
- T1native_biasfieldcorr.nii.gz: T1weighted MR image in native subject space, not skull-stripped, but bias field corrected.
- T1native_biasfieldcorr_noskull.nii.gz: T1weighted MR image in native subject space, skull-stripped and bias field corrected.
- All of the above additionally...

  - for the T2-weighted image (e.g. T2native.nii.gz)
  - in MNI atlas space (e.g. T1mni_biasfieldcorr.nii.gz)

- Brain masks in subject- and atlas-space
- Bias field masks in subject- and atlas-space
- Label maps in subject- and atlas-space

Toy Example
--------------------

The toy example data files in the data directory are taken from the Sherwood library [1]_.
