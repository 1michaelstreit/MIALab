Pipeline
========

The figure below shows our presented medical image analysis pipeline with the steps that are performed. The dashed boxes indicate pre-steps or selections that influence a step. The provided experiments (see :ref:`experiments_label`) correspond to boxes in the figure.
Therefore the pipeline takes two inputs (i.e. one T1-weighted image and one T2-weighted image) and has one output (i.e. the segementation)
